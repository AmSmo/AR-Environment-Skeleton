# AR-Environment-Skeleton

You can use this repo to build new Activerecord projects

* You will need to create your own app/models directories

Methods that active record created
required in deliverables:
    - .grade_level
    - .all
    - built in .last_name, .first_name (for students) .years_of_expereience
extras: .find, .all, .find_by, .where etc etc...

Methods we have to code 
- #full_name (interpolate the two table rows together)
- .all_in_grade (in sql or .where but with conditions)
- #tenure (conditional find)
